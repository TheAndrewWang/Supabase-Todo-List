## Todo List made with Nextjs & Supabase

I created this project based off this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyphLGnSz6Q

Using v0 from vercel, I created a simple frontend with Nextjs, where I then connected Supabase
and added a CRUD system for my Todo list.

When you CRUD items, it should update to your Supabase database as well. I would highly recommend checking this app out if you want to experiment with Supabase or if you are a beginner looking to learn to use Supabase and its functions.
